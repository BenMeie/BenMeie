### Who am I?

I'm a Senior Computer Science student and CSUMB as well as a Minecraft Marketplace developer. I love learning and tinkering with new technology and have a particular fascination for web technologies and game development. Designing and building systems for users to interact with is of particular interest to me. I've created many many things over the years, some of which you can find on right here, and I hope to continue building many more experiences in the years to come!

### Current Projects

I'm currently building MCCreations, a brand new platform for Minecraft Creators to come together and post their awesome creations in Minecraft. The MCCreations frontend is public here on Github and is built using Next.JS and integrations with Vercel, AWS and my custom API, Scaffolding. Scaffolding is built with Node.JS, Express, MongoDB and Meilisearch, allowing for fast and easy storage and lookup of the complex projects that creators submit.
